# Pedestrian Detection and Counting using YOLOv8

This project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained YOLOv8 model for pedestrian detection and then utilizing the fine-tuned model for counting pedestrians crossing a designated line in a video.

## Overview

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Fine-Tuning YOLOv8 for Pedestrian Detection

- Used a pedestrian dataset to fine-tune a pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
- Achieved reliable accuracy in detecting individuals in various environments.

### Counting Pedestrians

- Implemented a counting mechanism using the fine-tuned YOLOv8 model.
- Utilized the YOLOv8 Object Counter to count pedestrians crossing a specified line in the video.
